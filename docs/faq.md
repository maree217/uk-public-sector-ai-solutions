### Are these open source?
Solutions are available under MIT License. Each repository contains full source code, documentation, and deployment templates.

### Who maintains these solutions?
Solutions are maintained by a community of UK public sector practitioners, developers, and implementation partners.

### How much do they cost?
Typical costs range from £2-25 per user/home/property per year depending on the solution, deployment model, and organisation size. See individual solution repositories for detailed pricing.

## Technical Questions

### What infrastructure do I need?
- **Cloud:** Azure UK South or AWS London account
- **Hybrid:** On-premise API gateway + cloud AI
- **On-premise:** Servers with 8+ vCPU, 32GB RAM

### Is it accessible?
Yes. All solutions meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## Implementation Questions

### Can I pilot one solution first?
Yes, this is recommended. Most organisations start with a single high-impact solution (e.g., Citizen Service Assistant, HR Policy Assistant) before expanding.

### Do I need an implementation partner?
Not required but recommended for faster deployment. See [Partner Network](../resources/partners.md).

### What training is provided?
Each solution includes user guides, video tutorials, and technical documentation. Implementation partners offer hands-on training.

### What support is available?

## ROI & Benefits

### What's the typical ROI?
Most solutions achieve 3-12 month payback periods with 200-400% ROI over 3 years.

### What are the main benefits?
