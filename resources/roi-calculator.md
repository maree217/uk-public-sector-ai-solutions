# ROI Calculator

Calculate the return on investment for AI solutions in your organisation.

## 🧮 Quick ROI Estimation

### Step 1: Identify Your Metrics

**Time Savings:**
- How many hours/month are spent on this process?
- What is the average hourly cost (salary + overheads)?
- How much time will AI save (typically 30-70%)?

**Volume Metrics:**
- How many transactions/queries per month?
- Current cost per transaction?
- Expected cost reduction per transaction?

**Revenue Protection:**
- Current revenue at risk?
- Expected improvement percentage?

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Savings

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Hours Saved × Hourly Cost × 12 months) +
                 (Transactions × Cost Reduction × 12 months) +
                 (Revenue Protected)
```

### Step 3: Compare to Investment

**Investment Costs:**
- Solution licensing: £X per year
- Implementation: One-time £Y
- Training: One-time £Z
- Ongoing support: £A per year

**Total First Year Cost:** £Y + £Z + £X + £A

**ROI Period:** Total First Year Cost ÷ (Annual Savings ÷ 12)

## 📊 Example Calculations

### Example 1: Citizen Service Assistant
**Organisation:** District Council (100k population)

**Current State:**
- Contact centre: 10,000 calls/month
- Average handling time: 12 minutes
- Cost per call: £4.50
- Monthly cost: £45,000

**With AI:**
- AI handles 60% of calls (6,000/month)
- Cost per AI interaction: £0.80
- Human calls reduced to 4,000/month
- New monthly cost: £18,000 (human) + £4,800 (AI) = £22,800

**Annual Savings:** (£45,000 - £22,800) × 12 = £266,400

**Investment:**
- Implementation: £35,000
- First year license: £18,000
- Training: £5,000
- Total: £58,000

**ROI:** 58,000 ÷ (266,400 ÷ 12) = **2.6 months payback**

**3-Year ROI:** £266,400 × 3 = £799,200 savings vs £58,000 + (£18,000 × 2) = £94,000 total cost = **750% ROI**

### Example 2: Repairs Scheduler (Housing)
**Organisation:** Housing Association (12,000 homes)

**Current State:**
- Repairs per year: 24,000
- Diagnostic visits: 30% (7,200)
- Cost per diagnostic visit: £65
- Annual diagnostic cost: £468,000
- First-time fix rate: 65%

**With AI:**
- AI diagnosis reduces diagnostic visits to 15% (3,600)
- Cost per AI diagnosis: £2
- Annual diagnostic cost: £234,000 + £48,000 (AI) = £282,000
- First-time fix improves to 85%

**Annual Savings:**
- Diagnostic visits: £468,000 - £282,000 = £186,000
- Reduced repeat visits (improved first-time fix): £95,000
- **Total: £281,000**

**Investment:**
- Implementation: £45,000
- First year license: £24,000
- Total: £69,000

**ROI:** £69,000 ÷ (£281,000 ÷ 12) = **2.9 months payback**

### Example 3: HR Policy Assistant
**Organisation:** County Council (5,000 employees)

**Current State:**
- HR queries: 250/week
- Average handling time: 20 minutes
- HR advisor cost: £35/hour
- Weekly cost: £2,917 (250 × 20min × £35/hr)
- Annual cost: £151,667

**With AI:**
- AI resolves 65% of queries (162/week)
- Cost per AI query: £0.15
- HR queries reduced to 88/week
- New weekly cost: £1,027 (human) + £24 (AI) = £1,051

**Annual Savings:** (£2,917 - £1,051) × 52 = £97,032

**Investment:**
- Implementation: £15,000
- First year license: £12,000
- Total: £27,000

**ROI:** £27,000 ÷ (£97,032 ÷ 12) = **3.3 months payback**

### Example 4: Arrears Predictor (Housing)
**Organisation:** Housing Association (8,000 homes)

**Current State:**
- Rent roll: £32m/year
- Arrears: 3.5% (£1.12m)
- Collection costs: £180,000/year
- Write-offs: £85,000/year

**With AI:**
- Early intervention reduces arrears to 2.8% (£896k)
- Revenue protected: £224,000
- Collection costs reduced by 25%: £45,000 saving
- Write-offs reduced by 40%: £34,000 saving

**Annual Savings:** £224,000 + £45,000 + £34,000 = £303,000

**Investment:**
- Implementation: £35,000
- First year license: £16,000
- Total: £51,000

**ROI:** £51,000 ÷ (£303,000 ÷ 12) = **2.0 months payback**

## 💡 Tips for Accurate ROI

1. **Be Conservative** - Underestimate savings, overestimate costs
2. **Include Hidden Costs** - Training, change management, ongoing support
3. **Consider Soft Benefits** - Improved satisfaction, staff morale, reputation
4. **Account for Gradual Adoption** - Full benefits may take 6-12 months
5. **Factor in Data Quality** - Poor data may delay benefits
6. **Include Opportunity Cost** - What could staff do with freed time?
